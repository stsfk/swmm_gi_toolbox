The functions included in *interface_function.R* are designed to couple the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s [Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm) and other green infrastructure (GI) models.

Documentation and several application examples can be found: https://stsfk.github.io/swmm_gi_toolbox/index.html. The examples are included in the *example* folder. Detailed application steps are explained in the *example\*.RMD* files. Please clone the repository to the local disk to follow the examples.

The theory behind the toolbox can be found in the paper, [*"Incorporating External Green Infrastructure Models into Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) Simulations Using Interface Files"*](https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12883).
